### Final Capstone Project for 16-week Skill Distillery Bootcamp

  CampFree is an online guide to dispersed camping in the United States. Our community
members can view, create, and comment on our list of dispersed camping sites. Non registered
users are still afforded most of the functionality, but cannot create campsites or make
community comments. Our goal is to educate and provide the best community-sourced
dispersed camping information.

### Team
* Michael Degginger- Developer, SCRUM Master
* Vince Borden- Developer, DBA
* Mike Matosky- Developer, Repo Owner

### Overview

A NonUser can view all campsites and information, along with the ability to register
to become a member of our community.

A User can maintain a user profile, as well as create and edit campsites and comment
on other campsites. The user profile contains previous images, created campsites,
and personal information.

The functionality focuses on the profile page and the main homepage with the map
and expansive list of campsite data. It is reliant on crowd-sourced information
from its users.

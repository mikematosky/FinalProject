## CampFree

### Final Capstone Project for 16-week Skill Distillery Bootcamp

  CampFree is an online guide to dispersed camping in the United States. Our community
members can view, create, and comment on our list of dispersed camping sites. Non registered
users are still afforded most of the functionality, but cannot create campsites or make
community comments. Our goal is to educate and provide the best community-sourced
dispersed camping information.

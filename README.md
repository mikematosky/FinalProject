### Final Capstone Project for 16-week Skill Distillery Bootcamp

  CampFree is an online guide to dispersed camping in the United States. Our community
members can view, create, and comment on our list of dispersed camping sites. Non registered
users are still afforded most of the functionality, but cannot create campsites or make
community comments. Our goal is to educate and provide the best community-sourced
dispersed camping information.

### Overview

CampFree is a free application for the dispersed camping community that focuses
on crowd-sourcing created or existing campsites with no fees or reservations. While
some may opt to pay and hassle with reservations for busy campgrounds, not many
realize that there is plenty of public land available for camping which results
in a better connection with nature and a more somber camping experience.

The functionality focuses on the profile page and the main homepage with the map
and expansive list of interactive campsite data. This map and list is reliant on
crowd sourced data from its enthusiastic users.
